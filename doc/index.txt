The PyNIfTI module is a Python_ interface to the `NIfTI I/O libraries`_.  Using
PyNIfTI, one can easily read and write NIfTI and ANALYZE images from within
Python. The :class:`~nifti.image.NiftiImage` class provides pythonic access to the
full header information and for a maximum of interoperability the image data is
made available via NumPy_ arrays.

Binary packages are available for:

* Debian and Ubuntu (:ref:`installation instructions <install_debian>`)
    PyMVPA is an `official Debian package`_ (`python-nifti`).
    Additionally, backports for some Debian and Ubuntu releases are also
    available. Please read the `package repository instructions`_ to learn
    about how to obtain them.

* RPM-based GNU/Linux distributions (:ref:`installation instructions <install_rpm>`)
    RPM packages are provided through the `OpenSUSE Build Service`_. The
    currently supported distributions include: CentOS 5, Fedora 9, Mandriva
    2007-2008, RedHat Enterprise Linux 5, SUSE Linux Enterprise 10, OpenSUSE
    10.2 up to 11.0. The build service supports `RPM-package repositories`_ and
    `1-click-installations`_.

Source code
-----------

Source code tarballs of PyNIfTI releases are available from the `download
area`_. Alternatively, one can also download a tarball of the latest
development snapshot_ (i.e. the current state of the *master* branch of the
PyNIfTI source code repository).

To get access to both the full PyNIfTI history and the latest
development code, the PyNIfTI Git_ repository is publicly available. To view the
repository, please point your webbrowser to gitweb:
http://git.debian.org/?p=pkg-exppsy/pynifti.git

To clone (aka checkout) the PyNIfTI repository simply do:

::

  git clone git://git.debian.org/git/pkg-exppsy/pynifti.git

After a short while you will have a `pynifti` directory below your current
working directory, that contains the PyNIfTI repository.

More detailed instructions on :ref:`installation requirements <requirements>`
and on how to :ref:`build PyNIfTI from source <buildfromsource>` are provided
in the manual.
