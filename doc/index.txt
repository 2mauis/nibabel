The NiBabel module is a Python_ package for reading and writing a
variety of medical image formats.  Using NiBabel, one can easily read
and write NIfTI and ANALYZE images from within Python. The
:class:`~nibabel.Nifti1Image` class provides access to the full header
information and for a maximum of interoperability the image data is made
available via NumPy_ arrays.

Download

Binary packages
---------------

You probably won't need a binary package because NiBabel is pure Python.
However, there will be packages for:

* Debian and Ubuntu (:ref:`installation instructions <install_debian>`)
    NiBabel is an `official Debian package`_ (`python-nibabel`).
    Additionally, backports for some Debian and Ubuntu releases are also
    available. Please read the `package repository instructions`_ to learn
    about how to obtain them.

* RPM-based GNU/Linux distributions (:ref:`installation instructions <install_rpm>`)
    RPM packages are provided through the `OpenSUSE Build Service`_. The
    supported distributions may include: CentOS 5, Fedora 9-10, Mandriva
    2007-2008, RedHat Enterprise Linux 5, SUSE Linux Enterprise 10, OpenSUSE
    10.2 up to 11.0. The build service supports RPM-package repositories (`Suse
    and Mandriva-related`_ and `Fedora, Redhat and CentOS-related`_) and
    `1-click-installations`_.

* MacOS X (:ref:`installation instructions <install_macos>`)
    NiBabel is available from the MacPorts_ framework.

* Windows (:ref:`installation instructions <install_win>`)
    An installer for Python 2.5 is available from the `download area`_.
