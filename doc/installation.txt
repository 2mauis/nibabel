Installation
************

It should be fairly easy to get PyNIfTI running on any system. For the most
popular platforms and operating systems there are binary packages provided in
the respective native packaging format (DEB, RPM or installers). On all other
systems PyNIfTI has to be compiled from source -- which should also be pretty
straightforward.


Binary packages
===============

.. _install_debian:

GNU/Linux
---------

PyNIfTI is available in recent versions of the Debian (since lenny) and
Ubuntu (since gutsy in universe) distributions. The name of the binary package
is ``python-nifti`` in both cases.

* PyNIfTI `versions in Debian`_

* PyNIfTI `versions in Ubuntu`_

Binary packages for some additional Debian and (K)Ubuntu versions are also
available. Please visit `Michael Hanke's APT repository`_ to read about how
you have to setup your system to retrieve the PyNIfTI package via your package
manager and stay in sync with future releases.

If you are using Debian lenny (or later) or Ubuntu gutsy (or later) or you
have configured your system for `Michael Hanke's APT repository`_ all you
have to do to install PyNIfTI is this::

  apt-get update
  apt-get install python-nifti

This should pull all necessary dependencies. If it doesn't, it's a bug that
should be reported.

.. _versions in Debian: http://packages.debian.org/python-nifti
.. _versions in Ubuntu: http://packages.ubuntu.com/python-nifti
.. _Michael Hanke's APT repository: http://apsy.gse.uni-magdeburg.de/main/index.psp?page=hanke/debian&lang=en&sec=1


.. _install_rpm:

Additionally, there are binary packages for several RPM-based distributions,
provided through the `OpenSUSE Build Service`_. To install one of these
packages first download it from the `OpenSUSE software website`_. Please note,
that this site does not only offer OpenSUSE packages, but also binaries for
other distributions, including: CentOS 5, Fedora 9, Mandriva 2007-2008, RedHat
Enterprise Linux 5, SUSE Linux Enterprise 10, OpenSUSE 10.2 up to 11.0.  Once
downloaded, open a console and invoke (the example command refers to PyMVPA
0.3.1)::

  rpm -i python-nifti-0.20080710.1-4.1.i386.rpm

The OpenSUSE website also offers `1-click-installations`_ for distributions
supporting it.

A more convenient way to install PyNIfTI and automatically receive software
updates is to included one of the `RPM-package repositories`_ in the system's
package management configuration. For e.g. OpenSUSE 11.0, simply use Yast to add
another repository, using the following URL:

  http://download.opensuse.org/repositories/home:/hankem/openSUSE_11.0/

For other distributions use the respective package managers (e.g. Yum) to setup
the repository URL.  The repositories include all dependencies of PyMIfTI, if
they are not available from other repositories of the respective distribution.

.. _OpenSUSE software website: http://software.opensuse.org/search?baseproject=ALL&p=1&q=python-nifti
.. _OpenSUSE Build Service: https://build.opensuse.org/


.. _install_win:

Windows
-------

A binary installer for a recent Python version is available from the
nifticlibs Sourceforge_ project site.

There are a few Python distributions for Windows. In theory all of them should
work equally well. However, I only tested the standard Python distribution
from www.python.org (with version 2.5.2).

First you need to download and install Python. Use the Python installer for
this job. Yo do not need to install the Python test suite and utility scripts.
From now on we will assume that Python was installed in `C:\\Python25` and that
this directory has been added to the `PATH` environment variable.

In addition you'll need NumPy_. Download a matching NumPy windows installer for
your Python version (in this case 2.5) from the `SciPy download page`_ and
install it.

PyNIfTI does not come with the required `zlib` library, so you also need to
download and install it. A binary installer is available from the `GnuWin32
project`_. Install it in some arbitrary folder (just the binaries nothing
else), find the `zlib1.dll` file in the `bin` subdirectory and move it in the
Windows `system32` directory.

Now, you can use the PyNIfTI windows installer to install PyNIfTI on your
system.  As always: click *Next* as long as necessary and finally *Finish*.  If
done, verify that everything went fine by opening a command promt and start
Python by typing `python` and hit enter. Now you should see the Python prompt.
Import the nifti module, which should cause no error messages::

  >>> import nifti
  >>>

.. _GnuWin32 project: http://gnuwin32.sourceforge.net/


.. _install_macos:

Macintosh
---------

A binary package for a recent Python version is provided in the download area
of the SourceForge_ project.


.. _requirements:
.. _buildfromsource:

Compile from source
===================

If no binary packages are provided for your platfom, you can build PyNIfTI from
source. It needs a few things to build and run properly:

*  Python_ 2.4 or greater
*  NumPy_
*  SWIG_
*  `NIfTI C libraries`_
     Proper developer packages are prefered, but for convenience reasons a
     minimal copy is included in the PyNIfTI source package.

.. _NumPy: http://numpy.scipy.org
.. _SWIG: http://www.swig.org

Get the sources
---------------

Since June 2007 PyNIfTI is part of the niftilibs_ family. The source code of
PyNIfTI releases can be obtained from the corresponding Sourceforge_ project
site. Alternatively, one can also download a tarball of the latest development
snapshot_ (i.e. the current state of the *master* branch of the PyNIfTI source
code repository).

.. _Sourceforge: http://sourceforge.net/
.. _snapshot:  http://git.debian.org/?p=pkg-exppsy/pynifti.git;a=snapshot;h=refs/heads/master;sf=tgz

If you want to have access to both, the full PyNIfTI history and the latest
development code, you can use the PyNIfTI Git_ repository on the Alioth_
server, a service kindly provided by the `Debian project`_.
To view the repository, please point your web browser to gitweb:

  http://git.debian.org/?p=pkg-exppsy/pynifti.git

The gitweb browser also allows to download arbitrary development snapshots
of PyNIfTI. For a full clone (aka checkout) of the PyNIfTI repository simply
do::

  git clone http://git.debian.org/git/pkg-exppsy/pynifti.git

.. _niftilibs: http://niftilib.sourceforge.net
.. _Git: http://git.or.cz
.. _Alioth: http://alioth.debian.org

Compiling: General instructions
-------------------------------

Make sure that the compiled nifticlibs and the corresponding headers are
available to your compiler. If they are located in a custom directory, you
might have to specify ``--include-dirs`` and ``--library-dirs`` options to
the build command below. In case, you want to build and use the nifticlibs
copy that is shipped with PyNIfTI, this is automatically done for you.

Once you have downloaded the sources, extract the tarball and enter the root
directory of the extracted sources. If you *do not* have the nifticlibs
installed, run::

  make

in the root of the extracted source tarball. If you have system-wide installed
nifticlibs available on your system, instead simply do::

  python setup.py build

That should build the SWIG wrappers. If this has been done successfully, all you
need to do is install the modules by invoking::

  sudo python setup.py install

If sudo is not configured (or even installed) you might have to use
``su`` instead.

Now fire up Python and try importing the module to see if everything is fine.
It should look similar to this::

  Python 2.4.4 (#2, Oct 20 2006, 00:23:25)
  [GCC 4.1.2 20061015 (prerelease) (Debian 4.1.1-16.1)] on linux2
  Type "help", "copyright", "credits" or "license" for more information.
  >>> import nifti
  >>>

.. _NIfTI C libraries: http://niftilib.sourceforge.net


Building on Windows Systems
---------------------------

On Windows the whole situation is a little more tricky, as the system doesn't
come with a compiler by default. Nevertheless, it is easily possible to build
PyNIfTI from source. One could use the Microsoft compiler that comes with
Visual Studio to do it, but as this is commercial software and not everybody
has access to it, I will outline a way that exclusively involves free and open
source software.

First one needs to install the Python_ and NumPy_, if not done yet. Please
refer to the installation intructions for the Windows binary package below.

Next we need to obtain and install the MinGW compiler collection. Download the
*Automated MinGW Installer* from the `MinGW project website`_. Now, run it and
choose to install the `current` package. You will need the *MinGW base tools*,
*gcc* **and** *g++* compiler and *MinGW Make*. For the remaining parts of the
section, we will assume that MinGW got installed in `C:\\MinGW` and the
directory `C:\\MinGW\\bin` has been added to the `PATH` environment variable,
to be able to easily access all MinGW tools. Note, that it is not necessary to
install `MSYS`_ to build PyNIfTI, but it might handy to have it.

In addition, PyNIfTI needs the developer version of the `zlib` library, so you
also need to download and install it. A binary installer is available from the
`GnuWin32 project`_. It is best to install it into the same directory as MinGW
(i.e. `C:\\MinGW` in this example), as all paths will be automatically
configured properly.

You also need to download SWIG_ (actually *swigwin*, the distribution for
Windows). SWIG does not have to be installed, just unzip the file you
downloaded and add the root directory of the extracted sources to the `PATH`
environment variable (make sure that this directory contains `swig.exe`, if
not, you haven't downloaded `swigwin`).

PyNIfTI comes with a specific build setup configuration for Windows --
`setup.cfg.mingw32` in the root of the source tarball. Please rename this file
to `setup.cfg`. This is only necessary, if you have *not* configured your
Python distutils installation to always use MinGW instead of the Microsoft
compilers.

Now, we are ready to build PyNIfTI. The easiest way to do this, is to make use
of the `Makefile.win` that is shipped with PyNIfTI to build a binary installer
package (`.exe`). Make sure, that the settings at the top of `Makefile.win`
(the file is located in the root directory of the source distribution)
correspond to your Python installation -- if not, first adjust them accordingly
before your proceed. When everything is set, do::

  mingw32-make -f Makefile.win installer

Upon success you can find the installer in the `dist` subdirectory. Install it
as described below.


.. _MinGW project website: http://www.mingw.org/
.. _MSYS: http://www.mingw.org/msys.shtml



MacOS X and MacPython
---------------------

When you are comiling PyNIfTI on MacOS X and want to use it with MacPython,
please make sure that the NIfTI C libraries are compiled as fat binaries
(compiled for both *ppc* and *i386*). Otherwise PyNIfTI extensions will not
compile.

One can achieve this by adding both architectures to the ``CFLAGS`` definition
in the toplevel Makefile of the NIfTI C library source code or in the file
`3rd/nifticlibs/Makefile` if you are using the nifticlibs copy that is shipped
with the PyNIfTI sources. Like this::

  CFLAGS=-Wall -O2 -I. -DHAVE_ZLIB -arch ppc -arch i386


Troubleshooting
===============

If you get an error when importing the ``nifti`` module in Python
complaining about missing symbols your niftiio library contains references to
some unresolved symbols. Try adding ``znzlib`` and ``zlib`` to the
linker options the PyNIfTI ``setup.py``, like this::

  libraries = [ 'niftiio', 'znz', 'z' ],
