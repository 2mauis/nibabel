3rd/nifticlibs/
---------------

The source tarball contains a partial copy of the NIfTI C libraries. This
code is placed into the public domain. Quote from LICENSE file:


> Niftilib has been developed by members of the NIFTI DFWG and volunteers in
> the neuroimaging community and serves as a reference implementation of the
> nifti-1 file format.
>
> http://nifti.nimh.nih.gov/
>
> Nifticlib code is released into the public domain, developers are encouraged
> to incorporate niftilib code into their applications, and, to contribute
> changes and enhancements to niftilib.

However, the corresponding libraries are available from the nifticlib source
package (or rather the binary packages it builds). Therefore this code is
not used and the respective packages are used as dependencies. This copy of
the nifticlibs code is, however, left in place, as it does not hurt and does
not justify repackaging of the upstream sources.
