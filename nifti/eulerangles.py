Euler's rotation theorem tells us that any rotation in 3D can be
described by 3 angles.  Let's call the 3 angles the *Euler angle vector*
and call the angles in the vector :math:`alpha`, :math:`beta` and
:math:`gamma`.  The vector is [ :math:`alpha`,
:math:`beta`. :math:`gamma` ] and, in this description, the order of the
parameters specifies the order in which the rotations occur (so the
rotation corresponding to :math:`alpha` is applied first).

In order to specify the meaning of an *Euler angle vector* we need to
specify the axes around which each of the rotations corresponding to
:math:`alpha`, :math:`beta` and :math:`gamma` will occur.

There are therefore three axes for the rotations :math:`alpha`,
:math:`beta` and :math:`gamma`; let's call them :math:`i` :math:`j`,
:math:`k`. 

Let us express the rotation :math:`alpha` around axis `i` as a 3 by 3
rotation matrix `A`.  Similarly :math:`beta` around `j` becomes 3 x 3
matrix `B` and :math:`gamma` around `k` becomes matrix `G`.  Then the
whole rotation expressed by the Euler angle vector [ :math:`alpha`,
:math:`beta`. :math:`gamma` ], `R` is given by::

   R = np.dot(G, np.dot(B, A))

See http://mathworld.wolfram.com/EulerAngles.html

The order :math:`G B A` expresses the fact that the rotations are
performed in the order of the vector (:math:`alpha` around axis `i` =
`A` first).

To convert a given Euler angle vector to a meaningful rotation, and a
rotation matrix, we need to define:

* the axes `i`, `j`, `k`
* whether a rotation matrix should be applied on the left of a vector to
  be transformed (vectors are column vectors) or on the right (vectors
  are row vectors).
* whether the rotations move the axes as they are applied (intrinsic
  rotations) - compared the situation where the axes stay fixed and the
  vectors move within the axis frame (extrinsic)
* the handedness of the coordinate system

See: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rotation_matrix#Ambiguities

We are using the following conventions:

* axes `i`, `j`, `k` are the `z`, `y`, and `x` axes respectively.  Thus
  an Euler angle vector [ :math:`alpha`, :math:`beta`. :math:`gamma` ]
  in our convention implies a :math:`alpha` radian rotation around the
  `z` axis, followed by a :math:`beta` rotation around the `y` axis,
  followed by a :math:`gamma` rotation around the `x` axis.
* the rotation matrix applies on the left, to column vectors on the
  right, so if `R` is the rotation matrix, and `v` is a 3 x N matrix
  with N column vectors, the transformed vector set `vdash` is given by
  ``vdash = np.dot(R, v)``.
* extrinsic rotations - the axes are fixed, and do not move with the
  rotations.
* a right-handed coordinate system

The convention of rotation around ``z``, followed by rotation around
``y``, followed by rotation around ``x``, is known (confusingly) as
"xyz", pitch-roll-yaw, Cardan angles, or Tait-Bryan angles.
