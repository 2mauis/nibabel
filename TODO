Yarik's wishes unsorted - please remove or fulfill ;-)

- all functions returning header values should be properties, and in
  ideal case should be r/w - ie I could change them as well

- function/property to get/set all header information in a single
  dictionary

- constructor to create NiftiFile from another one but with different
  shape/dims (so the other header information gets preserved... it is somewhat
  eliminated with feature above if I can only copy all header information
  besides shape from one file to another)

- failed save* and constructors should raise exception
