Yarik's wishes sorted - please remove or fulfill:

- dims/shape property for NiftiImage
- timepoints property
   yoh: made initial attempt to accomplish the mission. Check diff to
   237
   hanke: Mission accomplished ;)

Possibly wrong/incorrect/wontfix suggestions:

- [gs]etVoxDims should work with all dimensions up to 7 as they are
   defined in nifti1_io.h
   hanke: maybe, but that would mix different units, which I'd rather not do.
